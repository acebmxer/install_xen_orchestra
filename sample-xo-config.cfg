# Xen Orchestra Installation Configuration
# Copy this file to xo-config.cfg and modify as needed
# =====================================================

# HTTP port for Xen Orchestra web interface
HTTP_PORT=80

# HTTPS port for Xen Orchestra web interface
HTTPS_PORT=443

# Installation directory for Xen Orchestra
INSTALL_DIR=/opt/xen-orchestra

# SSL certificate directory
SSL_CERT_DIR=/etc/ssl/xo

# SSL certificate file names
SSL_CERT_FILE=xo-cert.pem
SSL_KEY_FILE=xo-key.pem

# Git branch to use (master, stable, or specific tag)
# - master: Latest development version with newest features
GIT_BRANCH=master

# Backup directory for updates
# Backups are created automatically before updates and rebuilds
BACKUP_DIR=/opt/xo-backups

# Number of backups to keep
# Older backups are automatically purged after this limit
BACKUP_KEEP=5

# Node.js version to install (LTS 20 recommended)
# Comes with npm v10
NODE_VERSION=20

# Service user (leave empty or comment out to run as root)
# You can use any username here - the script will create the user if needed.
# Default is "xo", but you can specify any name (e.g., SERVICE_USER=myuser)
# 
# Running as root: Process runs as root user (UID 0)
# Running as dedicated user: Process runs as specified user with root group membership
#                           and elevated privileges for NFS/CIFS compatibility
# 
# When SERVICE_USER is set to a non-root user:
# - The user is created (if needed) and added to the root group (GID 0) for file access
# - Sudo is configured to allow mount operations without password
# - The service runs with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability for mounting
# - This provides similar NFS access as running with SERVICE_USER empty (root)
# 
# Both configurations work with existing NFS shares without server-side changes.
# Using a dedicated user provides better process isolation.
SERVICE_USER=xo

# Enable debug mode (true/false)
# Shows additional logging information
DEBUG_MODE=false

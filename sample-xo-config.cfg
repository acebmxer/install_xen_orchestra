# SSL certificate directory

# Git branch to use (master, stable, or specific tag)
# - master: Latest development version with newest features
GIT_BRANCH=master

# Backup directory for updates
# Backups are created automatically before updates and rebuilds

# Node.js version to install (LTS 20 recommended)

NODE_VERSION=20

# Service user (leave empty or comment out to run as root)
# Running as root: Process runs as root user (UID 0)
# Running as dedicated user (xo): Process runs as xo user but with root group membership
#                                  and elevated privileges for NFS/CIFS compatibility
# 
# When SERVICE_USER=xo:
# - The xo user is added to the root group (GID 0) for file access
# - Sudo is configured to allow mount operations without password
# - The service runs with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability for mounting
# - This provides similar NFS access as running with SERVICE_USER empty (root)
# 
# Both configurations work with existing NFS shares without server-side changes.
# Choose SERVICE_USER=xo for better process isolation.
SERVICE_USER=xo

# Enable debug mode (true/false)
# Shows additional logging information
DEBUG_MODE=false
